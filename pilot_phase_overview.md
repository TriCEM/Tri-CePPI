### Pilot Study Objective 
 1. The Pilot Study will use existing data to parameterize and validate a spatially explicit simulation model; this model will stress-test and expand current methods of characterizing early-stage transmission in relation to incomplete sampling and behavioral feedback. 
2. As a practical first step towards achieving actual research goals, the Pilot Study teams will validate and extend current methods for assessing transmission histories on contact networks, and investigate the ways that contact networks are shaped by information flow, risk aversion, economic decision making, cultural factors, and institutional behavior.
3. The Pilot Study will stress-test and advance existing methods for inferring transmission trees and contact networks. The Pilot Study team will integrate spatial simulations, statistical modeling, and existing data available to our Triangle Universities team. 


### Data for Model Parameterization
- **Nunn and Moody** have ongoing GPS-logger data on 620 people and 237 domesticated animals from two villages in Madagascar that will inform movement patterns in the model. 
- **Aiello** has data on human behavior in the context of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which will be used to inform how infectious disease alters contact patterns on social networks. 
- **Volfovsky, Xu, Aiello** recently gathered similar data on interactions amongst health care personnel within their clinical environment, via both worn and strategically placed sensors in COVID-19 patient settings.
- *Kibale Mobile Clinic vet funding?*
